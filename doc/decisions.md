## Optional commas

Nah

To be clear, ending commas are optional.  All commas are not optional.

Leaving commas off is a pain to edit after the fact, and relies on invisible
characters (newlines) for semantics.  So say, it might not be immediately
apparent reading a bytestream of Sylva source code that commas are optional.
