# Sylva

Sylva is an applications programming language; it is built for writing
applications, including system applications like IRC servers or login daemons.

Sylva is memory and data race safe.  You cannot write a program in Sylva that
will result in bugs like use after free, torn reads/writes, or out-of-bounds
memory accesses.

Sylva is fast.  It requires no runtime, and always offers the programmer the
fastest method of doing anything.

Sylva strives to be familiar.  Where possible, it defers to what the programmer
is likely to know.
